# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
- Move the web application instance to private subnet.
- Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to connect to EC2 wihout SSH key pair.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
- No, create a VPC gateway endpoint for S3 bucket and make this bucket to non-pulic. The S3 will only receive the traffic in the VPC with specified resources allowed in the policy configuration.
Because IAM permissions are still insecure, so the policy configurations of the VPC gateway endpoint are still insecure (the IAM permissions are the same as the policy configurations of the VPC gateway endpoint)

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, the encryptionn only apply for new objects.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
- With the original cloud formation templates, the VPC with insecure configuration of security groups is still created and apply to the new EC2 instances, also S3 buckets is still public with non-encrytion.
The original cloud formation templates should update to apply to this environment.
